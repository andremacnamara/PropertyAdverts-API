This application is a property advert website much like Daft.ie, or MyHome. I’m currently
implementing this as a sample project, as the majority of my work would be property of my
previous company. The API and Client projects are pinned to my GitHub.,

Features
• Multi step form – Including steps for image uploading, and advert payment.
• Image storage – Images are uploaded to Cloudinary using the API.
• Payments – Advert payments are processed by Braintree, using the API.
• API to Client Authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
• Property search which includes numerous filters such as county, town, price, rooms
etc.
